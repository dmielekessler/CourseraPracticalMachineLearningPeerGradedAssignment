# CourseraPracticalMachineLearningPeerGradedAssignment

This repository is for the Coursera Practical Machine Learning Peer Graded Assignment The index.md file contains the code and all graphics.
The html file viewed from here is html source code. As suggested in the assignment, I have created a gh-pages branch to facilitate html viewing. To view the rendered html, go to this link: https://dmielekessler.github.io/CourseraPracticalMachineLearningPeerGradedAssignment/
My apologies that the submission only allows for one link, instead of both. 

As stated in the assignment, the review criteria are:

"Review criteria
What you should submit
The goal of your project is to predict the manner in which they did the exercise. This is the "classe" variable in the training set. You may use any of the other variables to predict with. You should create a report describing how you built your model, how you used cross validation, what you think the expected out of sample error is, and why you made the choices you did. You will also use your prediction model to predict 20 different test cases.

Peer Review Portion
Your submission for the Peer Review portion should consist of a link to a Github repo with your R markdown and compiled HTML file describing your analysis. Please constrain the text of the writeup to < 2000 words and the number of figures to be less than 5. It will make it easier for the graders if you submit a repo with a gh-pages branch so the HTML page can be viewed online (and you always want to make it easy on graders :-)."

When rendered to word, the file is 879 words, well under to 2000 word maximum. There are 2 figures, under the maximum of 5. The files discusses how I built the model, cross validation (data set split to have a validation set), the expected out of sample error (accuracy of .992, which is 0.8% error rate) and why I made the choices I did.

Thank you.
